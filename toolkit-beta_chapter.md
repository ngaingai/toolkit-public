# Welcome to the Toolkit (Beta Chapter)

Hi, it's Alex! If you received this, it's because _you're in it!_

A lot of the content in this toolkit has been inspired by our conversations and interactions. Many deep issues emerged from our discussions and I realized that this information needed to be shared with other people in your position.

I've been writing (and re-writing) non-stop since the lockdown and I'm finally ready for a "Beta Release." Before I write too much by myself, I want to pause and see if this is going in the right direction.

So I need your help! Please read through this Beta Chapter and let me know how you feel about it. Take your time and there's no need to rush! Thanks in advance and I'll see you on the other side!

# Section 1: Overview

This toolkit is the result of 10,000+ conversations with Japanese professionals about why **thinking differently** is the missing link for success in America.

It’s for people who have a mid-high English level and want to take their career overseas. It’s mainly for those who haven’t worked abroad yet, but there’s plenty of tips for experienced expats too.

I wrote this toolkit because, even in 2020, people are still surprised when I tell them that Americans are _not_ friends with their coworkers. It's not their fault if they don't know basic facts about US business culture- especially since most Japanese workers are told to get career advice from language schools.

Language ability is definitely necessary, but that's not enough. It's meaningless if you can _speak_ like an American, but can't _think_ like an American. This toolkit disagrees with many traditional beliefs about working internationally, including the myths that you need an 800 TOEIC score, that cultural misunderstandings are "しょうがない," that you can't change a shy personality, and so on.

In this toolkit, I'll introduce the **mental models** (ways of thinking) that I feel are needed to successfully navigate American business culture. Then, to get you ready for working abroad, I'll show you how to build habits to start using these mental models in your daily life.

Speaking of working abroad, if you’re still reading this, your English level is already good enough to work in the US. You can keep studying language if you like, but it will be much harder to have a long career if you don't study the mentality as well.

These results are achievable for every career level and type of industry. It's not necessary to be naturally super-friendly and outgoing. That's another myth. Americans are just as shy as Japanese people, but they know how to "switch on" and change their behavior depending on the situation. You'll learn the mental model on how to do this too.

In addition to explaining the different mental models, this toolkit will provide resources on how to convert your dream goals into real action plans that you can work on every day.

To make this toolkit a complete reference for Japanese professionals going overseas, I’m going to continuously update it to include common scenarios, useful phrases, and many more tools.

> We’ll develop your:
>
> - **Tools** (Knowledge): The mental models
> - **Toolbox** (Habits): Practice using all of the different tools
> - **Toolkit** (Mastery): Control situations by using the right tool at the right time

Excited? Good. If you felt like working abroad was impossible, don't worry because you just found the missing link. While everyone else is still studying vocabulary lists, you can start making real progress towards your dream _today_.

Oh, and if you thought you were alone on this journey, you’re not. We’re building a community of ambitious future Japanese expats like you. Updates coming soon.

# Section 2: Mental Models

> You prepared _perfectly_ for a meeting with a potential American client, you:
>
> - Bowed deeply when you exchanged business cards
> - Invited all of your team to the meeting
> - Made a very detailed presentation
> - Showed your respect by taking care of them all day
> - You even brought them a box of local sweets.

But they **rejected** your offer and said to never contact them again.

### Why did this happen?

Because it was the wrong respect.

In America, _**Time is Money**_ and you respect someone by respecting their time.

_**Time is Money**_ is our first mental model.
_A mental model is just a specific way to think about things. They're like frameworks or filters that simplify complex situations so we can make quicker decisions or get new perspectives._

> Jeff Bezos (Amazon CEO) has a great mental model for making **tough decisions**:
>
> - Imagine you're 80 years old and looking back at your life.
> - Will you regret this choice?
>
> Let’s try it in these situations:
>
> > **I want this luxury car.** _80-year-old Me_: "I spent all my savings on that car and only drove it 3 times a month because gas was so expensive." => DON'T BUY.
> >
> > **Should I change my job?** _80-year-old Me_: "I worked in 1 company until retirement. I was bored and hated my department." => CONTACT A RECRUITER.
> >
> > **Do I order soda?** When I’m 80 I’m not going to remember this meal, so it doesn’t matter. _The real question is: why did I agree to have dinner with these people?_
>
> Jeff Bezos calls this mental model _**Regret Minimization**_ and he used it to quit his Wall Street job and start Amazon.

Now that we have some background on mental models, let's use _**Time is Money**_ and go back to the first scenario with the American client.

1. **You bowed deeply when you exchanged business cards:** Since you arranged this meeting, the client _already has_ your contact information- there's no need to give it again.
   - A handshake and some brief small-talk just before sitting down are enough.
   - The quicker you can agree to work together > The quicker the project can start > The quicker you can make money. _Time is money._
2. **You invited all of your team to the meeting:** In America, anyone who doesn't participate in the meeting is **unnecessary**. The client would see your team and probably think _"I can't believe these guys are all getting paid to just sit and do nothing."_ Its like they're all openly wasting the company's time and money.
3. **You made a very detailed presentation:** Reading slides directly from the screen is meaningless and, to an American, the presenter looks like they are unprepared and unconfident.
   - Just change the details into a PDF and email it to them before the meeting
   - Use the face-to-face time to persuade them with your passion, have a deeper discussion, or just _skip the presentation_ and go directly to the negotiation.
   - Also, if your slides are in English, they can read them faster than you can talk.
4. **You took care of them all day:** Americans don't usually mix business and pleasure. They are friendly but, if you met for business, they are not your friends.
   - It is best to prepare a clear agenda and follow the timetable
   - They expect to be paid for everything connected to business/work so if you stay together all day, that's the same as working overtime. _Time is money._
   - (See: _**Work hard, Play hard**_ Mental model.)
5. **You brought them a box of local sweets:** Check first if they have any food restrictions (allergies, gluten-free, Halal, etc.) They will appreciate the gift, but if you didn't check, they might think you don't care about them (See: _**On the same wavelength**_ Mental model.). Also, if they can't eat it, you wasted _your_ time and _your_ money.

###### Now, if you were that American client, how would you feel after this meeting?

In this scenario, we were originally confused by their rejection, but if we think about it with _**Time is Money**_, then the rejection starts to make sense. If we continue to look at it through other mental models like _**Work hard, Play hard**_ and _**On the same wavelength**_, we can get a deeper and deeper understanding of the situation and American business culture.

I like to think about each mental model as a **tool** and we collect all of them in our **toolbox**.
We'll fill up your toolbox with tools like:

- _**Three strikes**_
- _**See the big picture**_
- _**Bushido**_
- Many, many more

Having a complete toolbox can prepare us for almost any situation. But carrying it everywhere is too much- we'll just confuse ourselves. So I like to use the concept of preparing a **toolkit** with 2 or 3 of the most useful tools needed for a specific situation.
(For example: a negotiation toolkit, a project management toolkit, an angry customer toolkit, etc.)

But a tool is useless if we don't know how to use it.
A samurai would never read books about swords and then expect to win a fight the first time he picks up a sword. He needs to train everyday until the sword becomes a part of him and he's ready to use it anytime, anywhere.

These tools are exactly the same.

You can't read these words and then expect to be able to use the tools on your business trip tomorrow. Adapting a foreign mentality is basically like _re-programming our brains_. It takes time, training, and discipline to master them.

This sounds difficult but we do it by gradually building **new habits**.

# Section 3: Habits

First, let’s summarize the key points for _**Time is Money**_:

> - Respect people by respecting their time
> - Decisiveness and efficiency
> - Be simple, clear, and direct
> - All work-related time should be compensated

You probably already know or do some of these, but be honest, there's something on this list that you avoid or hesitate to do.

That's your weak point.

Let's build a **system** to kill that weak point forever.

1. Start with a key point from the mental model. (_Decisiveness, for example_)
2. Then look for a very **low-pressure** situation in your daily life to practice it. (_Decisiveness: Order your food within 60 seconds of opening a menu_)
3. Do this **everyday** for 5-7 weeks, very slowly increasing the difficulty level

In the beginning, we're just focusing on consistency and making the smallest possible improvement. Make your daily goal _super, super easy_- so easy that you can't make any excuse to avoid it. I heard a guitar teacher say that beginners should practice for 3 minutes everyday. That's enough.
When that becomes too easy, start taking bigger and bigger challenges.

Research says that it takes 5-7 weeks to build new habits. Let’s start today.

I’ve included a **habit tracker** in this toolkit.
The rules are easy:

1. Write the mental model (tool) you want to develop
2. Check today's box if you used the tool to:

   a. **Build** a habit

   b. **Break** a bad habit

3. Repeat tomorrow

Here are some examples on how to start using _**Time is Money**_ in your daily life and work. This is just a basic list to spark your imagination, I encourage you to make your own.

> - Respect people by respecting their time
>   - Respond to text messages quicker
>   - Complete a meeting 5 minutes before the scheduled end time
> - Decisiveness
>   - Choose your outfit 30 seconds after opening your closet
>   - Stop using "Maybe." If you can't decide, then it's a "No."
> - Be simple, clear, and direct
>   - Do one less back and forth email exchange
>   - If a 12-year old child can't understand you, it is not simple enough
> - All work-related time should be compensated
>   - Don't work overtime
>   - Reject social events with coworkers

Daily progress is slow, and it will be difficult to see clear results, but you're moving in right direction. You'll probably want to stop after a week or two—your weak points don't want to die yet—but keep going.

Mastery is achieved with consistency, not speed.

Focus on the process. The best outcome is that you stop caring about achieving goals and you learn to love the process itself.

# Section 4: Scenarios

_**Time is Money**_, so if you stop reading right now, you have enough to go and start trying out the tool.

For those who like to get deep into the details, this section is for you. It covers specific scenarios and gives you more cultural context. You can see how to proactively apply _**Time is Money**_ to not only avoid misunderstandings, but to control the situation and maximize your chance of success.

## 4a) Time is Money: Negotiations

Negotiations, especially between two totally different cultures like Japan and America, is a complex topic that needs to be looked at from a variety of angles. This section looks at it through _Time is money_ and we'll be re-visiting this topic with other mental models as well. My hope is that it by looking at negotiation with different tools, you'll begin to develop a wider understanding of this subject, and many others.
Note: It is _highly_ recommended that you also put _**On the same wavelength**_ and _**See the big picture**_ in your negotiation toolkit.

### Culture Context

How many years do Americans work at one company (average):

- A. 0-2
- B. 3-5
- C. 6-10
- D. 10+

The answer is B, but why does this matter?
It matters because, as you probably know, the answer is D in Japan.

It's standard to develop personal relationships before doing business in Japan. This is understandable since you know that the other person will be in that company until they retire. So with such a long time-frame, there's no rush and the contract can be seen as an agreement between _two individuals_.

For Americans, the contract is purely seen as an agreement between _two companies_. So the personal relationship is not necessary and in many cases, the negotiator knows that the contract will last longer than their own time at the company.

_**Time is money**_ so getting the project started and finished are the top priorities.
There's no need to have deep personal relationships before doing business. Plus, they're probably job-hunting already so their personal career goals take the next level of priority. As a result, Americans might seem aggressive or cold in negotiations, but really this is just part of _**time is money**_.

### Application

Now that we know _**time is money**_, let's use it to plan a negotiation with an American company.

- You can't sign the contract, so you invite your director to the meeting.
  - It takes too long to report and ask permission through every level of your organization
- The meeting is set for 60 minutes, so you prepare a clear agenda and email it to every meeting member 24 hours before the negotiation
  - The agenda makes sure that there is enough time to properly discuss all of the important points
- You prepare for each negotiation condition and you know how much each condition can be adjusted
  - Compromise quicker and eliminate the need to double check with others

## 4b) Time is Money: Presentations

## 4c) Time is Money: Networking

## 4d) Time is Money: Meetings

## 4e) Time is Money: Management

## 4f) Time is Money: Training

> _All coming soon._

**QUIZ TIME:**
Which is a better response, A or B?

Q: "So can you accept our offer?"

- A: "Thank you for the offer, there is a possibility. It is difficult, but I will contact you after I check with my boss and my team."
- B: "No."

_**Time is money.**_

# Thank YOU for reading the Beta Chapter of the Toolkit!

It's Alex again! As you know, it's the first time I've done something like this and I _really_ need your help.

I loved writing the Beta Chapter and can't wait to finish the whole toolkit. But I need your feedback because this project is meaningless if my audience (you!) is bored or doesn't understand it.

#### I respect your judgement and I trust you to be direct with me.

You know me personally, so you know I hate having weak points- I need you to help me _kill_ those weaknesses! My goal is to create the most **amazing** toolkit _ever!_ So I need direct (and negative!) feedback to improve this as much as possible. Criticism will help me focus and motivate me to make this toolkit better and better.

I would really appreciate it if you could give me some feedback [here](https://forms.gle/PsgcBbmno2QVgAGp6)

## Thank you!

Thanks for inspiring me to write this, thanks for taking the time to read it, and thanks for coming on this journey with me!
